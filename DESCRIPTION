Description: Computes confidence intervals for the rate (or risk)
    difference ('RD') or rate ratio (or relative risk, 'RR') for 
    binomial proportions or Poisson rates, or for odds ratio 
    ('OR', binomial only). Also confidence intervals for a single 
    binomial or Poisson rate, and intervals for matched pairs. 
    Includes skewness-corrected asymptotic score ('SCAS') methods, 
    which have been developed in Laud (2017) <doi:10.1002/pst.1813>
    from Miettinen & Nurminen (1985) <doi:10.1002/sim.4780040211> and 
    Gart & Nam (1988) <doi:10.2307/2531848>. Also includes MOVER methods
    (Method Of Variance Estimates Recovery) for all contrasts, derived 
    from the Newcombe method but using equal-tailed Jeffreys intervals,
    and generalised for Bayesian applications incorporating prior 
    information. So-called 'exact' methods for strictly conservative 
    coverage are approximated using continuity corrections.
    Also inlcudes methods for stratified calculations (e.g. meta-analysis),
    either assuming fixed effects or incorporating stratum
    heterogeneity.
