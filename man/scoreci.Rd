\arguments{
\item{x1, x2}{Numeric vectors of numbers of events in group 1 & group 2
respectively.}

\item{n1, n2}{Numeric vectors of sample sizes (for binomial rates) or exposure
times (for Poisson rates) in each group.}

\item{distrib}{Character string indicating distribution assumed for the input
data: "bin" = binomial (default), "poi" = Poisson.}

\item{contrast}{Character string indicating the contrast of interest: "RD" =
rate difference (default), "RR" = rate ratio, "OR" = odds ratio.
contrast="p" gives an interval for the single proportion or rate x1/n1.}

\item{level}{Number specifying confidence level (between 0 and 1, default
0.95).}

\item{skew}{Logical (default TRUE) indicating whether to apply skewness
correction (for the SCAS method recommended in Laud 2017) or not (for
the Miettinen-Nurminen method).}

\item{simpleskew}{Logical (default FALSE) indicating whether to use the
"simplified" skewness correction instead of the quadratic solution.
See Laud 2021 for details. NOTE: this version of the score is only
suitable for obtaining confidence limits, not p-values.}

\item{ORbias}{Logical (default is TRUE for contrast="OR", otherwise
NULL) indicating whether to apply additional bias correction for OR derived
from Gart 1985. (Corrigendum to Laud 2017, published May 2018).
Only applies if contrast is "OR".}

\item{RRtang}{Logical (default TRUE) indicating whether to use Tang's score
Stheta = (p1hat - p2hat * theta) / p2d (see Tang 2020).
Only relevant for stratified = TRUE, for contrast = "RR" and
weighting = "IVS" or "INV". Ignored for other contrasts, or if
weighting = "MH". Experimental for distrib = "poi".}

\item{bcf}{Logical (default TRUE) indicating whether to apply bias correction
in the score denominator. Applicable to distrib = "bin" only. (NB: bcf =
FALSE option is really only included for legacy validation against previous
published methods (i.e. Gart & Nam, Mee, or standard Chi-squared test).}

\item{cc}{Number or logical (default FALSE) specifying (amount of) continuity
correction. Numeric value is taken as the gamma parameter in Laud 2017,
Appendix S2 (default 0.5 if cc = TRUE).
IMPORTANT NOTES:
1) This is a 'continuity correction' aimed at approximating strictly
conservative coverage, NOT for dealing with zero cell counts. Such
'sparse data adjustments' are not needed in the score method,
except to deal with double-zero cells for RD (& double-100% cells for
binomial RD & RR) with IVS weights.
2) The continuity corrections provided here have not been fully tested for
stratified methods.}

\item{sda}{Sparse data adjustment (default 0.5 for RD & RR)}

\item{theta0}{Number to be used in a one-sided significance test (e.g.
non-inferiority margin). 1-sided p-value will be <0.025 iff 2-sided 95\% CI
excludes theta0. If bcf = FALSE and skew = FALSE this gives a
Farrington-Manning test.
By default, a two-sided test against theta0 = 0 (for RD) or 1 (for RR/OR)
is also output: if bcf = FALSE and skew = FALSE this is the same as
Pearson's Chi-squared test.}

\item{precis}{Number (default 6) specifying precision (i.e. number of decimal
places) to be used in optimisation subroutine for the confidence interval.}

\item{plot}{Logical (default FALSE) indicating whether to output plot of the
score function}

\item{plotmax}{Numeric value indicating maximum value to be displayed on
x-axis of plots (useful for ratio contrasts which can be infinite).}

\item{hetplot}{Logical (default FALSE) indicating whether to output plots for
evaluating heterogeneity of stratified datasets.}

\item{xlim}{pair of values indicating range of values to be plotted.}

\item{ylim}{pair of values indicating range of values to be plotted.}

\item{stratified}{Logical (default FALSE) indicating whether to combine
vector inputs into a single stratified analysis.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The mechanism for stratified calculations is enabled for
contrast = "p", but the performance of the resulting intervals has not
been fully evaluated.}

\item{weighting}{String indicating which weighting method to use if
stratified = "TRUE":
"IVS" = Inverse Variance of Score (default, see Laud 2017 for details),
"INV" = Tang's inverse variance weights (bias correction omitted),
"MH" = Mantel-Haenszel (default for contrast = "RD" or "RR"),
"MN" = Miettinen-Nurminen iterative weights.
For CI consistent with a CMH test, select skew = FALSE and use
MH weighting for RD/RR and IVS for OR.}

\item{MNtol}{Numeric value indicating convergence tolerance to be used in
iteration with weighting = "MN".}

\item{wt}{Numeric vector containing (optional) user-specified weights.}

\item{tdas}{(deprecated: parameter renamed to random)}

\item{random}{Logical (default FALSE) indicating whether to perform random
effects meta-analysis for stratified data, using the t-distribution (TDAS)
method for stratified data (defined in Laud 2017).
NOTE: If random = TRUE, then skew = TRUE only affects the per-stratum
estimates.}

\item{prediction}{Logical (default FALSE) indicating whether to produce
a prediction interval (work in progress).}

\item{warn}{Logical (default TRUE) giving the option to suppress warnings.}

\item{...}{Other arguments.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components: \describe{
  \item{estimates}{a matrix containing estimates of the rates in each group
  and of the requested contrast, with its confidence interval} \item{pval}{a
  matrix containing details of the corresponding 2-sided significance test
  against the null hypothesis that p_1 = p_2, and one-sided significance
  tests against the null hypothesis that theta >= or <= theta0}
  \item{call}{details of the function call} } If stratified = TRUE, the
  following outputs are added: \describe{ \item{Qtest}{a vector of values
  describing and testing heterogeneity} \item{weighting}{a string indicating
  the selected weighting method} \item{stratdata}{a matrix containing stratum
  estimates and weights}}
}
\description{
Score-based confidence intervals for the rate (or risk) difference ("RD") or
ratio ("RR") for independent binomial or Poisson rates, or for odds ratio
("OR", binomial only). Including options for bias correction (from Miettinen
& Nurminen), skewness correction ("GNbc" method from Laud & Dane, developed
from Gart & Nam, and generalised as "SCAS" in Laud 2017) and continuity
correction (for strictly conservative coverage).
Also includes score intervals for a single binomial proportion or Poisson
rate. Based on the Wilson score interval, when corrected for skewness,
coverage is almost identical to the mid-p method, or Clopper-Pearson
when also continuity-corrected.
Hypothesis tests for superiority or non-inferiority are provided using the
same score, to ensure consistency between test and CI.
This function is vectorised in x1, x2, n1, and n2.  Vector inputs may also be
combined into a single stratified analysis (e.g. meta-analysis), either using
fixed effects, or the more general random effects "TDAS" method, which
incorporates stratum variability using a t-distribution score (inspired by
Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman).
For fixed-effects analysis of stratified datasets, with weighting = "MH" for
RD or RR, or weighting = "IVS" for OR, omitting the skewness correction
produces the CMH test, together with a coherent confidence interval for the
required contrast.
