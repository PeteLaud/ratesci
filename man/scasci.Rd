  n1,
  x2 = NULL,

  contrast = "RD",
  level = 0.95,

}
\arguments{
\item{x1, x2}{Numeric vectors of numbers of events in group 1 & group 2
respectively.}

\item{n1, n2}{Numeric vectors of sample sizes (for binomial rates) or exposure
times (for Poisson rates) in each group.}

\item{distrib}{Character string indicating distribution assumed for the input
data: "bin" = binomial (default), "poi" = Poisson.}

\item{contrast}{Character string indicating the contrast of interest: "RD" =
rate difference (default), "RR" = rate ratio, "OR" = odds ratio.
contrast="p" gives an interval for the single proportion or rate x1/n1.}

\item{level}{Number specifying confidence level (between 0 and 1, default
0.95).}

\item{cc}{Number or logical (default FALSE) specifying (amount of) continuity
correction. Numeric value is taken as the gamma parameter in Laud 2017,
Appendix S2 (default 0.5 if cc = TRUE).
IMPORTANT NOTES:
1) This is a 'continuity correction' aimed at approximating strictly
conservative coverage, NOT for dealing with zero cell counts. Such
'sparse data adjustments' are not needed in the score method,
except to deal with double-zero cells for RD (& double-100% cells for
binomial RD & RR) with IVS/INV weights.
2) The continuity corrections provided here have not been fully tested for
stratified methods.}

\item{theta0}{Number to be used in a one-sided significance test (e.g.
non-inferiority margin). 1-sided p-value will be <0.025 iff 2-sided 95\% CI
excludes theta0. By default, a two-sided test against theta0 = 0 (for RD)
or 1 (for RR/OR) is also output.}

\item{precis}{Number (default 6) specifying precision (i.e. number of decimal
places) to be used in optimisation subroutine for the confidence interval.}

\item{plot}{Logical (default FALSE) indicating whether to output plot of the
score function}

\item{plotmax}{Numeric value indicating maximum value to be displayed on
x-axis of plots (useful for ratio contrasts which can be infinite).}

\item{stratified}{Logical (default FALSE) indicating whether to combine
vector inputs into a single stratified analysis.
IMPORTANT NOTE: The mechanism for stratified calculations is enabled for
contrast = "p", but the performance of the resulting intervals has not
been fully evaluated.}

\item{weighting}{String indicating which weighting method to use if
stratified = "TRUE":
"IVS" = Inverse Variance of Score (see Laud 2017 for details),
"INV" = Inverse Variance (bcf omitted, default for contrast = "OR"),
"MH" = Mantel-Haenszel (default for contrast = "RD" or "RR"),
"MN" = Miettinen-Nurminen iterative weights.
For CI consistent with a CMH test, select skew = FALSE and use
MH weighting for RD/RR and IVS for OR.}

\item{MNtol}{Numeric value indicating convergence tolerance to be used in
iteration with weighting = "MN".}

\item{wt}{Numeric vector containing (optional) user-specified weights.}

\item{...}{Other arguments.}
}
\description{
Wrapper function for the SCAS method. Score-based confidence intervals for
the rate (or risk) difference ("RD") or ratio ("RR") for independent binomial
or Poisson rates, or for odds ratio ("OR", binomial only), or the single rate
("p"). (This is the "GNbc" method from Laud & Dane, developed from Gart &
Nam, and generalised as "SCAS" in Laud 2017) including optional
continuity correction.  This function is vectorised in x1, x2, n1, and n2.
Vector inputs may also be combined into a single stratified analysis (e.g.
meta-analysis). This method assumes the contrast is constant across strata
(fixed effects).  For a 'random-effects' method use tdasci (or scoreci with
random = TRUE).
